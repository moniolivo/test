I think once.\n\nJL: Did the person know it?\n\nGA: Yes.\n\nJL: Did anything come of it?\n\nGA: No.\n\nJL: The person wasn’t interested?\n\nGA: Scared.\n\nJL: So, this fell to the wayside?\n\nGA: No, we’re friends. It’s hard on me though. It’s very hard.\n\nJL: How long ago was it?\n\nGA: It’s been about, um, six years?\n\nJL: So you were about 31?\n\nGA: Yes. Sometimes I’m not sure what love is. I don’t think–sometimes I think I’m not-I’ve never been in love. I mean I know what love is, but I don’t know what “in love” is. Do you know what I mean?\n\nJL: So the person was not in love with you?\n\nGA: I think he is, but he is a gay man, and he has a gay lover.\n\nJL: You don’t need that\n\nGA: I don’t need that. And I think we both feel that way about each other, but it’s not the right situation.\n\nJL: No, I mean, if he’s a gay man, he’s going to want to make love to a man, instead of a woman, don’t you think?\n\nGA: Oh, yeah.",
